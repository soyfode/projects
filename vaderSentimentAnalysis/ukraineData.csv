"Medvedev’s statement - 2nd September: “The leaders of the Bandera-influenced ""Ukraine"" are increasingly talking about the necessity of ""holding all Russians accountable"" (it's clear that by ""Russians,"" they mean the entire population of our country, regardless of nationality). Hasn't something like this happened before? Nearly all heads of Western countries support Bandera Ukraine. Therefore, Biden, Trudeau, Sunak, Scholz, Macron, Meloni, as well as the leaders of the most abhorrent Poland, the bristling Scandinavian countries, militaristic Japan, furry creatures from Australia and New Zealand, and other pestilent fleas like the Baltic states, are direct and overt supporters of the Nazis. Their relationship should be approached as leaders of countries in a Nazi coalition. Rather than indulging in sweet dreams of reconciliation and living as a large polyamorous family with non-binary genders, as we once thought, we should treat them accordingly.”","Sep 2, 2023 · 9:02 AM UTC"

“We have to abandon Ukraine to focus on China.” I’ve dedicated years of my life to opposing the Chinese dictatorship. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs even denounced me at an international press conference. And I will tell you this argument is WRONG. China is already helping Russia. They’ve already formed a new Pact of Steel and they are arming Russia every day to slaughter Ukrainians. They are closely studying Ukraine as a test of Western resolve. They are drawing lessons they will use on Taiwan. We have an opportunity to nip this unholy alliance at the bud NOW by supporting Ukraine and beating back Russian aggression. If we don’t take this chance now we will regret it for the rest of the century.,"Dec 29, 2023 · 1:36 PM UTC"
